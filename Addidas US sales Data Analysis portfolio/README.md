## Steps Performed

### 1. Import Libraries
We import the necessary libraries that will allow us to manipulate, analyze, and visualize the data effectively.
- **Libraries Used**:
  - **numpy**: For numerical computation (used when performing calculations on data).
  - **pandas**: For data manipulation, cleaning, and analysis, especially for handling CSV files.
  - **matplotlib.pyplot**: For creating visualizations (graphs, charts) to better understand the data.
These libraries form the foundation for the data analysis and visualization steps in this project.

### 2. Load the Data
- To load the data set i have used directory path. I have uploaded the uncleaned data set inside the data sub folder and use this directory "../01_Data/01_Adidas US Sales uncleaned data set.csv" ton convert the data set into a data frame using pr.read_csv() code and inside the parethesis i have used the directory(given).

**Libraries Used**:
  - **pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis, especially useful for reading CSV files into DataFrames.

**Action**: The dataset is loaded into a pandas DataFrame using the **read_csv()** method. This allows us to easily manipulate, clean, and analyze the data in a structured format.

**Verification**: Display the first few rows using **df.head()** to confirm that the dataset has been loaded properly. This helps us ensure the data is correctly read and ready for the next steps in the analysis process.


### 3. Data Exploration
- Loaded the dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
- Displayed the first 10 rows to get an initial view of the data.
- Retrieved the column names to understand the dataset's structure.
- Checked the DataFrame's information to analyze data types and non-null counts of columns.
- Generated summary statistics to gain insights into the numerical data.
- Checked for missing values to ensure data completeness.
- Identified duplicate rows in the dataset.
- Examined duplicate columns by transposing the dataset for easier detection.
- Checked unique values in the **region**, **product**, and **sales_method** columns to understand the distribution of categorical data.


### 2. Data Cleaning
- Removed unnecessary columns: **sales_id**, **retailer_id**.
- Renamed columns for better understanding: **total_sales** to **revenue**, **operating_profit** to **profit**.
- Added a new column: **profit_margin** to represent profit as a percentage of revenue.
- Changed the data type of categorical columns to **string** for consistency and memory optimization.
- Converted the **invoice_date** column to **datetime** format to ensure proper date handling.


### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Examined distributions and relationships between variables.
- Analyzed trends over time.
- Investigated correlations between numerical columns.
- Explored statistical values such as min, max, mean, etc., for numerical columns like revenue, profit, profit_margin, price_per_unit, and units_sold.
- Detected outliers using the standard deviation method and visualized distributions through histograms.
- Identified the most and least sold products and examined month-wise sales, profit, and product trends.
- Generated a correlation matrix to explore relationships between numerical variables.

### 4. Data Visualization
- **Revenue and Profit by Region:**  
  Visualized profit and revenue for each region using bar charts to compare the performance of different regions.
- **Revenue and Profit by Product:**  
  Plotted bar charts to show how revenue and profit vary by product.
- **Monthly Sales Analysis:**  
  Analyzed product sales trends over the months by plotting a line chart for product units sold across each month.
- **Sales by Channel:**  
  Analyzed the performance of different sales channels (e.g., Online, Outlet, In-store) using a bar chart to show product sales by channel.
- **State-Level Profit Analysis:**  
  Displayed a bar chart for state-wise profit analysis and another for units sold across different states.
- **Units Sold vs. Profit Margin:**  
  Plotted a scatter plot to examine the correlation between the number of units sold and the profit margin, highlighting the relationship between these two variables.

## Key Insights

### Insight 1: Profit and Revenue by Region
- The West Region leads in both profit and revenue, while the Midwest lags behind. Focus on maintaining growth in the West and improving marketing strategies in the Midwest.

### Insight 2: Revenue and Profit by Product
- Men's Street Footwear drives the highest sales and profit, while Women's Athletic Footwear underperforms. Improve quality and design for the latter while expanding distribution of the former.

### Insight 3: Monthly Sales Trend
- August sees the highest sales, and June the lowest. Leverage Augustâ€™s success by applying similar strategies to June and plan for consistent sales growth post-August.

### Insight 4: Sales by Method
- Online sales dominate, followed by outlet sales, while in-store sales are the lowest. Enhance online sales strategies and improve in-store experiences with discounts and promotions.

### Insight 5: Profit and Sales by State
- California, Texas, and New York are top performers, while states like Nebraska, Maryland, and Minnesota underperform. Focus on maintaining strength in high-performing states and explore growth opportunities in underperforming areas.

### Insight 6: Units Sold and Profit Margin
- Low unit sales correlate with low profit margins, but high sales can result in higher profits. Optimize costs in low-performing regions and focus on profitable products and regions.
